## User stories
As a **disorganised person I want to:**
>  **Enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them.** 

>  **View the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day.** 

>  **Mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left.** 

>  **The to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb.** 

## How ? 
We divided our project to **four main parts** 

1- making tests for the main functions [add,delete,mark] in test.js file , then writing functions in logic.js file and checks the tests gradually One by One.

2- making the main HTML Structure for our app by working in dom.js file and add the required elements. 

3- Add The Style for Our App by writing the  Suitable styles in style.css file.
 
4- configure Web Storage settings .
